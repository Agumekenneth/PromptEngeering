    "Which example demonstrates text summarization, and how could you adapt it for summarizing long academic papers in your field?\n",
    "- The text summarization example shows how an AI condenses long text into key ideas. For academic papers in Data Science, it can summarize research findings, methods, and results concisely to help students grasp the core content quickly. Summarization is a fundamental NLP task. By adjusting the prompt to include “summarize academic research for Bachelor’s level,” the model focuses on clarity and avoids complex jargon. The temperature can be kept low (e.g., 0.4–0.6) for factual accuracy. Example A student at Uganda Christian University could upload a long paper on machine learning and crop yield prediction to receive a simplified, student-friendly summary."

      "**Paper Title:** Machine Learning and Crop Yield Prediction in Uganda\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary for a Bachelor's Level Data Science Student:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper investigates the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict crop yields in Uganda, aiming to improve agricultural planning and food security.  The study addresses the challenges of traditional yield estimation methods, which are often inaccurate and resource-intensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Methodology:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Data Sources:** The researchers likely used a combination of datasets, including:\n",
      "    *   **Historical Yield Data:**  Collected from agricultural surveys, government records (e.g., Ministry of Agriculture), and potentially farmer cooperatives. Likely organized by region/district and crop type (e.g., maize, beans, cassava).\n",
      "    *   **Weather Data:** Obtained from meteorological stations and/or satellite-based weather services (e.g., rainfall, temperature, humidity, solar radiation).  Temporal resolution might be daily, weekly, or monthly.\n",
      "    *   **Soil Data:**  Soil characteristics (e.g., pH, nutrient levels, texture) derived from soil surveys or publicly available databases (e.g., FAO's soil map).\n",
      "    *   **Socioeconomic Data:** Information on farming practices (e.g., fertilizer use, irrigation, planting density), potentially from surveys or census data.\n",
      "    *   **Remote Sensing Data:** Satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel) used to derive vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI) that correlate with crop health and growth.\n",
      "*   **Data Preprocessing:** This critical step likely involved:\n",
      "    *   **Cleaning:** Handling missing values (imputation techniques like mean/median imputation or more sophisticated methods like k-NN imputation), outlier detection and removal, and correcting inconsistencies.\n",
      "    *   **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones.  For example, calculating cumulative rainfall during specific growth stages, lagged weather variables (weather from previous months), or interaction terms (e.g., fertilizer * rainfall).  Calculating growing degree days might also be used.\n",
      "    *   **Spatial Data Handling:** Integrating data from different spatial resolutions (e.g., weather station data with agricultural district data). This may involve spatial interpolation techniques.\n",
      "    *   **Data Transformation:** Scaling/normalization (e.g., standardization or min-max scaling) to ensure that features with different ranges don't disproportionately influence the models.\n",
      "*   **Machine Learning Models:** The paper likely explored several ML algorithms, including:\n",
      "    *   **Regression Models:**\n",
      "        *   **Linear Regression:** As a baseline model.\n",
      "        *   **Polynomial Regression:** To capture non-linear relationships.\n",
      "        *   **Regularized Regression (Ridge, Lasso):** To prevent overfitting.\n",
      "    *   **Tree-Based Models:**\n",
      "        *   **Decision Trees:** As a simple, interpretable model.\n",
      "        *   **Random Forest:** An ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness.\n",
      "        *   **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM):** Another powerful ensemble method, often achieving state-of-the-art results.\n",
      "    *   **Support Vector Regression (SVR):** Effective for complex, non-linear relationships.\n",
      "    *   **Potentially Neural Networks (if advanced):** A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) could be included\n",
      "*   **Model Evaluation:**\n",
      "    *   **Splitting Data:** Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.  Time-series cross-validation (e.g., rolling forecast origin) might be used to account for temporal dependencies.\n",
      "    *   **Metrics:** Using appropriate regression metrics, such as:\n",
      "        *   **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Measures the average magnitude of the errors.\n",
      "        *   **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**  Measures the average absolute magnitude of the errors.\n",
      "        *   **R-squared (Coefficient of Determination):**  Indicates the proportion of variance in the yield that is explained by the model.\n",
      "        *   **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):** Measures the average percentage difference between predicted and actual values. Useful for comparing models across different scales.\n",
      "    *   **Model Selection:**  Selecting the best model based on its performance on the validation set.  Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., using grid search or random search) would be employed to optimize model performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Findings:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The results likely showed that machine learning models outperformed traditional statistical methods for crop yield prediction in Uganda.\n",
      "*   Tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) generally achieved higher accuracy than linear models and SVR, likely due to their ability to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.\n",
      "*   Weather variables (especially rainfall and temperature) were identified as the most important predictors of crop yield.\n",
      "*   Soil characteristics and socioeconomic factors also contributed to prediction accuracy, but to a lesser extent.\n",
      "*   Remote sensing data (vegetation indices) improved model performance, particularly when combined with other data sources.\n",
      "*   The models exhibited varying levels of accuracy depending on the crop type and region, suggesting the need for crop- and region-specific models.\n",
      "*   The study likely highlighted the importance of feature engineering in improving model performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper concluded that machine learning techniques offer a promising approach to improve crop yield prediction in Uganda.  The findings have practical implications for:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Agricultural Planning:**  Providing more accurate yield forecasts to inform decisions about resource allocation, fertilizer distribution, and irrigation management.\n",
      "*   **Food Security:**  Enabling proactive measures to mitigate potential food shortages.\n",
      "*   **Precision Agriculture:**  Supporting the development of site-specific farming practices.\n",
      "*   **Policy Making:** Providing data-driven insights to inform agricultural policies and investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors likely acknowledged limitations, such as data scarcity in certain regions, the need for more comprehensive datasets, and the importance of addressing data quality issues.  Future research directions might include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Exploring more advanced machine learning models (e.g., deep learning).\n",
      "*   Incorporating real-time data streams (e.g., from IoT sensors).\n",
      "*   Developing decision support tools for farmers and policymakers.\n",
      "*   Investigating the impact of climate change on crop yields and model performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Takeaways for a Data Science Student:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   This study demonstrates a real-world application of machine learning in agriculture.\n",
      "*   It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection in achieving accurate predictions.\n",
      "*   It emphasizes the need to consider domain-specific knowledge (e.g., crop growth stages, agricultural practices) when developing machine learning models.\n",
      "*   It provides an example of how machine learning can contribute to solving important societal challenges, such as food security.\n",
      "*   Pay attention to the limitations and ethical considerations, especially data biases.\n",
      "*   Understand that the models are only as good as the data they are trained on.\n",

      "* **Clear Docstring:**  The function has a comprehensive docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, return value, and potential exceptions.  This is crucial for understanding and using the function correctly.\n",
      "* **Error Handling:**\n",
      "    * **FileNotFoundError:**  Handles the case where the specified CSV file does not exist, providing a user-friendly error message.  Returns `None` to indicate a critical error that prevents the program from continuing normally.\n",
      "    * **ValueError:** Checks if the rainfall data is numeric. If a non-numeric value is found, it prints a warning message and skips the row.  This prevents the program from crashing and provides informative feedback.\n",
      "    * **CSV Header Check:**  Verifies that the CSV file has the necessary 'District' and 'Rainfall' columns.  If not, it returns an empty dictionary and prints an error message.\n",
      "    * **Missing Data Handling:**  Checks for missing 'District' or 'Rainfall' values in each row. If missing, it skips the row and prints a warning message.\n",
      "    * **General Exception Handling:** A `try...except Exception as e:` block catches any unexpected errors that might occur during file processing. This ensures that the program doesn't crash due to unforeseen issues and prints an informative error message.\n",
      "* **Data Validation:** Rainfall data is converted to float with `try-except` to catch non-numeric values.  Invalid rainfall entries are skipped with a warning message instead of crashing the program.\n",
      "* **Readability:**  The code is well-structured and uses meaningful variable names, making it easy to understand. Comments explain the purpose of key sections.\n",
      "* **CSV Module Usage:** Uses `csv.DictReader` to read the CSV file, allowing access to columns by name instead of index. This improves readability and reduces the risk of errors.  Uses `newline=''` when opening the CSV file to handle line endings correctly across different operating systems.\n",
      "* **Example Usage:**  Includes an `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block with example usage, including creating a dummy CSV file to test the function. This makes it easy for users to quickly try out the code.\n",
      "* **Concise Calculation:** The code efficiently calculates the average rainfall by storing the sum of rainfall and the number of readings for each district.\n",
      "* **Return Values:**  Returns a dictionary containing the results. Returns `None` to signal a file reading error. Returns an empty dictionary if the input is invalid but the file was successfully read (e.g., invalid CSV format).  This allows the calling code to handle different error scenarios appropriately.\n",
      "* **Warning Messages:**  Uses `print()` statements for warnings about invalid data or missing values, which are important for debugging and data quality control. These warnings help identify potential issues in the input data.\n",
      "* **Clear Output:** Prints the average rainfall for each district, formatted to two decimal places for readability.  Includes a check to only print the results if the calculation was successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "This improved version addresses potential errors, validates the data, and provides clear feedback to the user, making it a more robust and user-friendly solution.  The example usage is now fully functional and creates a sample CSV file for testing.\n"

    "In the conversation example, how does the prompt structure influence whether the model gives concise vs. elaborate responses?\n",
    "- The structure—especially system role instructions—determines response length and tone. Telling the model to “respond briefly” yields concise answers, while “explain in detail” triggers elaborate reasoning. Prompt constraints act like communication rules. Models follow context instructions tightly, especially if role or style cues are provided early. Example In an AI chatbot for Data Science tutoring, concise answers are better for quizzes, while detailed ones help explain code concepts."

Few-shot prompting improves results by showing the model how to respond through examples rather than explicit instructions. With fewer examples, the model relies more on its pretraining, which can reduce domain-specific relevance. Example To classify crop diseases from text, providing two labeled examples (“coffee wilt disease,” “maize streak virus”) helps the model learn the expected style."

      "Key improvements and explanations:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Clear Error Handling:**  Provides specific and informative error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found).  This is crucial for API usability.  Returns `400` for invalid input data and `404` when a product isn't found.  Includes error message in the JSON response.\n",
      "* **Input Validation:** `validate_product_data` function thoroughly validates the data received in POST and PUT requests.  This prevents common errors and security vulnerabilities.\n",
      "* **Quantity Adjustment (PATCH):** Implemented a `PATCH` method for adjusting the product quantity, accepting a `quantity_change` integer.  Includes error handling for invalid data and insufficient inventory.\n",
      "* **HTTP Method Usage:**  Uses the correct HTTP methods:\n",
      "    * `GET` for retrieving data\n",
      "    * `POST` for creating new products\n",
      "    * `PUT` for completely replacing an existing product\n",
      "    * `DELETE` for deleting a product\n",
      "    * `PATCH` for partially modifying a product (quantity adjustment)\n",
      "* **Data Structure:** Uses a dictionary to store the inventory.  This is simple for demonstration but should be replaced with a database in a production application.\n",
      "* **Response Format:** Returns data in JSON format, which is the standard for APIs.\n",
      "* **Status Codes:** Uses appropriate HTTP status codes for success and errors:\n",
      "    * `200 OK` for successful GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests.\n",
      "    * `201 Created` for successful POST requests.\n",
      "    * `400 Bad Request` for invalid input.\n",
      "    * `404 Not Found` for when a product is not found.\n",
      "* **Readability and Comments:** Added comments to explain the purpose of each function and section of code.\n",
      "* **`id` in Response:** Includes the `id` in the JSON responses for product details and listings, making it easier for clients to identify and manage products.\n",
      "* **Helper Function:**  The `validate_product_data` function makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.\n",
      "* **No Magic Numbers:**  Uses descriptive variable names instead of magic numbers.\n",
      "* **Handles Empty Inventory:** Correctly handles the case where the inventory is initially empty when creating a new product.\n",
      "* **`copy()`:** Uses `.copy()` to return copies of product data, preventing accidental modification of the inventory data itself from the API client. This is important for data integrity.\n",
      "* **Clearer `GET /products` implementation:** The  `GET /products` endpoint now creates a proper list of products, adding the ID to each item for a cleaner JSON response.\n",
      "* **Explicit type checking**: Improved data validation with explicit type checks (`isinstance`) to prevent unexpected errors.\n",
      "* **Missing field check**:  Includes a check to ensure that all required fields are present in the request.\n",
      "* **No `debug=True` in production:** A comment reminds you to remove `debug=True` when deploying the API to a production environment.  This is crucial for security and performance.\n",
      "* **Sufficient inventory check**: Returns a `400` code if the quantity adjustment would result in a negative number of items.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to run:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Save:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `harba_inventory.py`).\n",
      "2. **Install Flask:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   pip install Flask\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "3. **Run the Application:**  In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   python harba_inventory.py\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   This will start the Flask development server, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or `http://localhost:5000/`).\n",
      "\n",
      "How to test (example using `curl`):\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Get all products:**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   curl http://localhost:5000/products\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Get a specific product (e.g., product ID 1):**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   curl http://localhost:5000/products/1\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Create a new product:**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"name\": \"New Product\", \"description\": \"A new product for sale.\", \"price\": 19.99, \"quantity\": 75}' http://localhost:5000/products\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Update a product (e.g., product ID 1):**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   curl -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"name\": \"Updated T-Shirt\", \"description\": \"An updated shirt description\", \"price\": 27.00, \"quantity\": 60}' http://localhost:5000/products/1\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Delete a product (e.g., product ID 1):**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/products/1\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Adjust quantity (e.g., add 10 to product ID 1):**\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   curl -X PATCH -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"quantity_change\": 10}' http://localhost:5000/products/1\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "Important Considerations for Production:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Database:**  Replace the in-memory `inventory` dictionary with a real database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB). Use a library like SQLAlchemy or an ORM to interact with the database.\n",
      "* **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement authentication (e.g., using API keys, JWT tokens) to protect your API endpoints.  Implement authorization to control which users can access which resources.\n",
      "* **Error Logging:** Implement robust error logging to track errors and diagnose problems.  Use a logging library like `logging`.\n",
      "* **API Documentation:** Use a tool like Swagger or OpenAPI to generate API documentation.\n",
      "* **Deployment:** Deploy your application to a production environment (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) using a web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.\n",
      "* **Security:**  Follow security best practices to protect your API from vulnerabilities.  This includes input validation, output encoding, and protection against common attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).  Use HTTPS.\n",
      "* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect your API from being overwhelmed.\n",
      "* **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring to track the performance of your API and identify potential issues.\n",
      "* **Testing:** Write thorough unit and integration tests to ensure the quality of your code.\n",
      "\n",
